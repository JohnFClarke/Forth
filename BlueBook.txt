Here are the repositories (each is a directory with a .git subdirectory):
	On Linux:
		~/git/Forth 	 -- shows up on Eclipse Git Repositories perspective
			addedOnLinux.txt									19/10 10:57
						 -- not ignored by Eclipse it turns out. 
						 -- Changing this provokes a push&commit to GitHub.
		~/git/repository -- seems to be where Eclipse puts git project folders 
						 -- shows up on Eclipse Git Repositories perspective
						 -- everything under here is watched by Eclipse
						 -- and kept in sync with USB stick						 
			addedOnLinux.txt									19/10 11:27
						 -- not ignored by Eclipse
			/Forth 	     -- shows up as Eclipse project
				BlueBook.txt -- this file 
				addedOnLinuxEclipse.txt							19/10 11:02
				addedOnLinuxEclipseAndCommittedAndPushed.txt	19/10 11:04
				README.md										16/10 19:41

	On USB stick: 		 -- shows up on Eclipse Git Repositories perspective
		lots of coded stuff under Git/Git/objects
						 -- guess this is the place commit-and-push sends 
						 -- changes to ~/git/repository/Forth 
						 -- confirmed as Repository on Push Report message from Eclipse
		
	GitHub:
		Forth
			addedOnLinux.txt
			
	Android TermUX:
		Forth
				tester.fs										18/10 23:35

In the Git Repositories view of the Git perspective,
under 'Remotes/origin' are two lines that identify the remote repos:
	~/git/Forth has https://github.com/JohnFClarke/Forth
	~/git/repository has /media/john/16GSTICK2/Git/git (it's a bare repo)
	
The two lines are
	fetch 
	push
		
So let's tidy up the not-Eclipse one
	- let's leave one connected to github
	- let's not delete the ones under Eclipse
		these are all in ~/git/repository/Forth;
			addedOnLinux.txt
			addedOnLinuxEclipse.txt
			addedOnLinuxEclipseAndCommitAndPushed.txt
			BlockEd.fs
			BlueBook.txt
			inheritance.fs
			integer.fs
			README.md
			tester.fs
			wrapper.fs
		The ones under ~/git/repository/Forth not explicitly in Eclipse:
			.git
			.github
			.project
	- let's delete the ones not under Eclipse
		these are all in ~/git/Forth:
			addedOnLinux.txt
			.git
			.github	
		and in ~git/repository:
			addedOnLinux.txt
			.git
			.github
			.README.md.swp

Disconnect  ~/git/Forth
	git rm addedOnLinux.txt
	git commit
[main 336906d] git rm addedOnLinux.txt
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
 delete mode 100644 addedOnLinux.txt
				
Disconnect  ~/git/repository

It turns out that changes made in ~/git/repository/Forth directory cause
  a) staging in ~/git/repository/Forth/.git
  b) commit activity in github.
  
So we don't want to delete ~/git/repository/Forth/.git or ~/git/repository/Forth/.github
And we can maybe scrap ~/git/repository/.git ~/git/repository/.github
(,README.md.swp and addedOnLinux.txt have already gone.)

So we renamed ~/git/repository/.git and .github to was.git and was.github
Had to re-add ~/git/repository/Forth to the Git Repositories view.

Looks like we have lost the connection to /media/john/16GSTICK2/Git.
So also re-added /media/john/16GSTICK2/Git/git (it is --bare). But this doesn't
have any descendents under Linux '/'.
